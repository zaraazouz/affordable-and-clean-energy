    <h1>History & Current Events</h1>
    <p>Renewable energy and proper use of electricity are both very important to the sustainability of a country. Although
    fossil fuels may seem like the energy that is most easily relied upon, it isn’t sustainable for the environment. Then,
    renewable energy may seem the way to go but it’s expensive. The poorer countries simply can’t afford the renewable energy
    required to keep the environment safe and the energy that they use will be unsustainable as well. The countries that have
    natural gas tend to use it because it is a easy resource. Usually, these energy problems are directly correlated to
    economic problems or natural disasters. Non-renewable energy became integrated after a negative economic situation. After
    WWII, fossil and non-renewable energy boomed as Americans life began to change into more lavish life-styles. In Tanzania,
    due to constant droughts and reliance on other countries, non-renewable energy became an asset. Tanzania having little
    resources and no reliable other energy source, they have stayed with non-green energy (they have been exploring geothermal
    energy). In Japan after the Fukushima disaster, a earthquake and a tsunami that destroyed a power plant, they started to
    rely on non-renewable energy. With non-reliable renewable energy, Japan switched to fossil fuel, and now they rely on it
    entirely. In Iceland there was a economic crisis which caused prices of non-renewable resources such as bulks of oil to be
    unavailable. Due to this issue, Iceland found entrepreneurs to switch them to renewable energy, which was easy because of
    their ready resources. In Japan, there was the Fukushima disaster in 2011 which was an earthquake and tsunami that caused
    the meltdown of the Fukushima power plants. Also, there have recently been droughts throughout Tanzania. In Iceland there
    was a major issue of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining has invested in Iceland, but Iceland cannot afford the amount of
    energy needed for bitcoin mining. In America there is a issue of utility companies losing money because previous consumers
    are now selling renewable energy such as solar power. After the Fukushima power plant disaster, Japan was forced to
    reconsider there use of renewable resources. Soon after they switched to a more reliable resource such as fossil fuel. In
    Tanzania droughts have caused a lack of hydropower, resulting in frequent blackouts. With Iceland’s issue of bitcoin
    mining, there is a constant waste of energy of renewable energy. This will force Iceland to rely on fossil fuel rather
    than renewable energy. Due to utility companies making less money, they are constantly putting policies to reduce the use
    of renewable energy. Many of the energy problems in our world are caused by economic problems and natural disasters.
    Although the natural disasters cannot be prevented, the countries most impacted by them could use a safer method of
    energy. For example, Japan turned away from nuclear energy and resorted to fossil fuels. However that is not sustainable.
    In order for a country to find the most sustainable type of energy for them to use, it must be affordable for their
    country and also clean to sustain the environment.</p>
