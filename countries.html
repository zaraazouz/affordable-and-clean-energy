    <h1>Analysis of Countries</h1>
    <p>The topic of renewable energy is, simply put, a rich man’s problem. Countries whose economies aren’t doing so well are
    having trouble incorporating renewable energy because it is so expensive. Also, some countries have an abundance of
    natural gas or oil, and their economies are based on exports of fossil fuels. These countries also are reluctant to use
    clean energy methods. However, the benefits of an investment in renewable energy pays off. It is more sustainable, and
    preserves the environment as well as keeps the air quality at decent levels. There is no one solution to this problem, but
    there are many different ideas being explored to help save the environment. Tanzania is not a wealthy country. They used
    to have over 50% hydroelectricity, but after recent droughts, they have had to revert to fossil fuels. The Tanzanian
    government is looking into geothermal options, but they are already relying on other countries’ aid, so it would be tough
    to incorporate clean energy. However, these problems are hurting the wellbeing of the citizens, as there are frequent
    blackouts, and the air quality is poor.  Iceland is almost entirely run on renewable energy. It was also named the 20th
    richest country in the world in 2017. Their huge supply of renewable energy comes from their unique environment, being
    around a volcanic hotspot overflowing with geothermal energy. There have been talks between Iceland and the UK for selling
    some of their energy to the UK. However, the market of Bitcoin mining has been on the rise in Iceland, and many new data
    centers have been built. If it grows at the predicted rate, Bitcoin mining will use more energy than all the homes in the
    country. The government and energy companies are concerned that they won’t be able to supply enough energy in the future,
    and hurt Iceland because of it. Japan is also a wealthy country. They used to have lots of nuclear power, but after the
    nuclear meltdown, they have been using more fossil fuels. However, they have been able to explore various types of
    renewable energy because of their financial situation. The air is clean there, and the environment is preserved. The U.S.
    does have some clean energy, but in proportion to the relative wealth, many other countries pull ahead. The U.S. had poor
    air quality after the Industrial Revolution, and again after World War II, but since then efforts have been made to
    improve air quality. The U.S. now has more sustainable methods of energy, though the government still imports a lot of
    natural gas and oil. In conclusion, renewable energy is very beneficial to the citizens’ wellbeing in any given country,
    as it can improve the quality of life. However, not all countries can afford clean energy, even if the investment would
    benefit them in the future.</p>
